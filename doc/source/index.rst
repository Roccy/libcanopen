Welcome to libCANopen's documentation!
======================================

This CANopen library is intended to be used with the Linux SocketCAN driver for parsing and processing CANopen frames. The Linux SocketCAN is an excellent low-level driver framework for communicating with CAN networks, but it does not include any functions for processing CAN frames and their data. CANopen is a protocol on top of CAN, i.e., it is an application layer protocol that describes the format for the data in the CAN frames.
