Command-line applications
=========================

Here you'll find descriptions for the command-line applications that use libCANopen to perform simple CANopen related tasks, such as listening on a CAN bus and print CANopen frames, probe and change the state of CANopen devices, upload and download SDO and PDO records.

These command-line applications are intended to be useful tools for working with CANopen devices, but the code for these programs also makes good examples on how to use the libCANopen.
